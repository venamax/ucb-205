* Create a new OpenRefine Project and load the data
* Try to answer a few Questions 

Q1: Who gets the highest base pay in the city?
- To answer this question, instead of sorting on the Base Pay column, create a histogram of all Base Pays and navigate to the highest ones.
- A transformation is needed: 
--- Remove The "$" from salaries in Base Pay Column (use: value.replace("$", "") )
--- Transform values to numbers

Q2: Who gets the highest 'total pay + benefits' in the city?
Q3: Group all police related job titles to a 'Police' job title
Q4: Export all information related to 'Police' jobs to a new CSV file.
